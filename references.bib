  abstract =   "We present a set of advanced techniques for the
               visualization of 2D Poincare maps.  Since 2D Poincare maps
               are a mathematical abstraction of periodic or quasiperiodic
               3D flows, we propose to embed the 2D visualization with
               standard 3D techniques to improve the understanding of the
               Poincare maps.  Methods to enhance the representation of the
               relation $x\leftrightarrow{}P(x)$, e.g., the use of spot
               noise, are presented as well as techniques to visualize the
               repeated application of $P$, e.g., the approximation of $P$
               as a warp function.  It is shown that animation can be very
               useful to further improve the visualization.  For example,
               the animation of the construction of Poincare map $P$ is
               inherently a proper visualization.  During the paper we
               present a set of         examples which demonstrate the
               usefulness of our techniques.",

abstract = {Fusion edge plasmas can be far from thermal equilibrium and require the use of a non-linear collision operator for accurate numerical simulations. In this article, the non-linear single-species Fokker–Planck–Landau collision operator developed by Yoon and Chang (2014) [9] is generalized to include multiple particle species. The finite volume discretization used in this work naturally yields exact conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. The implementation of this new non-linear Fokker–Planck–Landau operator in the gyrokinetic particle-in-cell codes XGC1 and XGCa is described and results of a verification study are discussed. Finally, the numerical techniques that make our non-linear collision operator viable on high-performance computing systems are described, including specialized load balancing algorithms and nested OpenMP parallelization. The collision operator's good weak and strong scaling behavior are shown.}
